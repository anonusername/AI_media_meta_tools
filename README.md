# AI_media_meta_tools
AI generated images can contain metadata related to the generation process such as checkpoint models used, negative and postive prompts, LORAs used, and much MUCH more.  These are going to be tools/applications that will be able to scan images, pull the information of the picture, and store them for later use to help with your own generation.
